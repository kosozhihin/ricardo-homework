## What to do
You are given two projects, one in SwiftUI and one in UIKit, that are probably as unmaintainable as they can get. (Don't worry, this is not how our codebase looks like).

You are expected to update one of the codebases, to make it more maintainable and add tests to it.
SwiftUI is preferable, but UIKit based one is also okay, if you are not comfortable with SwiftUI.

You are free to use any architectural pattern, framework, testing library, etc.
We like seeing what you know :)

## Constraints
### Specifications

1. When the user enters the screen, there should be no error shown.
2. If the user presses the "Register" button, and the input is not valid, errors are shown.
3. If the focus is lost from a text field with invalid input, an error is shown.
4. Once the user presses the "Register" button or the focus is lost from a text field, the text field "becomes reactive", meaning the error message is dynamically shown/hidden while the user is typing.

### Time
Please do not spend more than 2 hours on the assignment. We would like to see good, working code, but perfection is not the goal.

### Logic
How you test it is up to you, as long as the general business rules stay the same.

## Done?
You can either compress the project, and email it back to the hiring manager, or you can create a public Github/Gitlab repository and share it with us.

Good luck!
